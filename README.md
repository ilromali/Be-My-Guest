## **Description**

Be my Guest is an application designed to make socially awkward situtions, less awkward by providing a platform to clearly communicate expectations and individual needs at social gatherings ahead of time. The concept was born out of the covid era's unique set of circumstances around social interactions and gatherings, but our team quickly realized how helpful the application could be beyond covid, too. Information like dietary restrictions/allergies, proper pronouns, correct or preferred names (especially for those of who might not forget your face but will definitely be stressed about remembering your name), being immune-compromised or high-exposure-level person could be shared within your event link for guests and host(s) alike to have pertinent information about guests at the ready. Take the stress and awkwardness out of coordinating events and communicating expectations!

Using the site as a Host allows you to create an event and invite a number of guests to your event. You can request that your guests fill out our built-in COVID questionnaire for any of your pre-screening needs. Add in our bonus Social Q's questionnaire to handle the less-than-comfortable conversations that are necessary but better suited to being addressed before our short windows of fun time together. In your event's info page, you are able to share with your guests what expectations to have for safety protocols of your gathering, as well as learn about any additional local or state gathering safety guidelines. As a guest, you can RSVP through our site to all the fun events you get invited to, and prepare ahead of time for any extra precautions you need to take. Additionally, when you are at the event, access Be My Guest on your mobile device to see who's who, to recognize when certain folks have additional safety needs or SocialQs they'd prefer, and to avoid socially awkward conversations like whether so-and-so would prefer a high five or an elbow tap over a hug. Even event planners and venues would benefit from the addition of Be My Guest to their operations, as specific venue requirements and other coordinations can be made in-app, for all guests to see ahead of time.

Be My Guest helps bring people together again - safely, and with respect to other's needs and preferences. We can't wait for our product to help make your events involve less social awkwardness, more community, and more fun!

  <summary>Expand for Database Installation Essentials!</summary>

### Database Connection

Create a connection string to connect the database to the web application.

1. Create one file in the CovidAPI folder and one file in the BeMyGuest folder, with both files called `appsettings.json`
2. Add the code below to each file:

```
{
    "Logging": {
        "LogLevel": {
          "Default": "Warning"
        }
      },
      "AllowedHosts": "*",
    "ConnectionStrings": {
        "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=be_my_guest;uid=root;pwd=YourPassword;"
    }
}
```

- Put in your MySQL password in `pwd=YourPassword`. Change the server, port, and uid if necessary.

### Import Database Using Entity Framework Core

1. Navigate to CovidApi directory in terminal
2. Use the command `dotnet ef database update` to generate the database on your local machine through Entity Framework Core
3. Navigate to BeMyGuest directory in terminal

<summary>Stretch Goals</summary>

- Implementing OAuth for user login.
- Integrate social media connections.
- There was a number of design-related features and little design flaws that we wanted to incorporate/fix, but did not have time to get through everything.
- The design logo wasn't as integrated into the app theme as much as we would have liked, and in a perfect world, would've had some Javascript incorporated to animate a "fly in" of the logo, etc.
- We wanted to create small icons or badges for some of the SocialQ's to be displayed in-app and when looking at a guest list or a guest's details.
- Including some visual representations of the guests in attendance (graphs, charts, etc) for viewing their host and other guests' important SocialQ's in mobile and desktop applications would be ideal.
- Additionally, we would have liked to incorporate JWT Token authorization for the API/UI.
- Being able to generate a specific event ID by a host creating an event that would then get sent to potential guests through an auto-generated email. This was a much loftier goal than could be accomplished with just four days, but with more time, would be essential to streamlined user experience.
- We would like to have all the views fully functional, as some of them currently are hard-coded or not as set up as we would like.
