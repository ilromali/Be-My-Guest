- Click on the green "Code" button and copy the repository URL
- Open your terminal and use the command `git clone ` into the directory you would like to clone the repository
- Open in text editor to view code and make changes

##### Installing .NET

In order to run the application, please install .NET for your computer to recognize the `dotnet` command.

### Database Connection

Create a connection string to connect the database to the web application

1. Create a file in the root directory called `appsettings.json`
2. Add the code below:

```
{
    "Logging": {
        "LogLevel": {
            "Default": "Warning"
        }
    },
    "AllowedHosts": "*",
    "ConnectionStrings": {
        "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=covid_api;uid=root;pwd=YourPassword;"
    }
}
```

- Put in your MySQL password in `pwd=YourPassword`. Change the server, port, and uid if necessary.

### Import Database Using Entity Framework Core

1. Navigate to CovidApi directory in terminal
2. Use the command `dotnet ef database update` to generate the database through Entity Framework Core

### Update Database Using Entity Framework Core

1. Write any new code you wish to add to the database. Use the command `dotnet build` to check for any compiling errors. If no errors, proceed to step 2.
2. To update the database with any changes made to the code, use the command `dotnet ef migrations add [MigrationsName]`
3. Use the command `dotnet ef database update` to update the database
